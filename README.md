## Objective

Provide source-code concepts from the [Solana whitepaper](https://github.com/solana-labs/whitepaper/blob/master/solana-whitepaper-en.pdf) in Rust to understand proof-of-history and the mechanics behind Solana further.

Used as an exercise to understand Proof of History further by writing a simple implementation as described in the whitepaper.
